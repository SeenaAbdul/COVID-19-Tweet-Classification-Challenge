# COVID-19-Tweet-Classification-Challenge
The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post is about COVID-19 or not. 
This model will help gather tweet data about the epidemic without relying only on key words like ‘covid’ or ‘coronavirus’ being present, allowing researchers and engineers to gather a more comprehensive dataset for sentiment analysis
The data used for this challenge has been collected by the Zindi team via Twitter API from tweets over the past year. The are ~7,000 tweets in the train set and ~3,000 in the test set
